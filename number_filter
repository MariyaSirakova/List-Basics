On the first line is single number n. On the following n lines - integers. After that, you
will be given one of the following commands:
• even
• odd
• negative
• positive
Filter all the numbers that fit in the category (0 counts as a positive and even). Finally, print the result.

number = int(input())
numbers = []
filtered_list = []

for _ in range(number):
    current_number = int(input())
    numbers.append(current_number)

command = input()

if command == 'even':
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            filtered_list.append(num)
elif command == 'odd':
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 != 0:
            filtered_list.append(num)
elif command == 'negative':
    for num in numbers:
        if num < 0:
            filtered_list.append(num)
elif command == 'positive':
    for num in numbers:
        if num >= 0:
            filtered_list.append(num)

print(filtered_list)
