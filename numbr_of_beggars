You will receive 2 lines of input. On the first line, you will receive a single string of integers, separated by a comma
and a space ", ". On the second line, you will receive a count of beggars. Your job is to print a list with the sum of
what each beggar brings home, assuming they all take regular turns, from the first to the last number in the list.

money_as_string = input().split(", ")
count_of_beggars = int(input())
money_as_digits = []

for element in money_as_string:
    money_as_digits.append(int(element))

start_index = 0
final_sum = []

while start_index < count_of_beggars:
    current_sum_of_beggar = 0
    for current_index in range(start_index, len(money_as_digits), count_of_beggars):
        current_sum_of_beggar += money_as_digits[current_index]
    final_sum.append(current_sum_of_beggar)
    start_index += 1
print(final_sum)
