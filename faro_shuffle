Write a program that receives a single string (cards separated by space) and on the second line receives a count of
faro shuffles that should be made. Print the state of the deck after the shuffle.
A faro shuffle is a method for shuffling a deck of cards, in which the deck is split exactly in half. Then the cards in the
two halves are perfectly interleaved, such that the original bottom card is still on the bottom and the original top
card is still on top.

faro_card = input().split()
count_of_shuffle = int(input())

for shuffle in range(count_of_shuffle):
    final_shuffle = []
    middle_of_card = len(faro_card) // 2
    left_side = faro_card[: middle_of_card]
    right_side = faro_card[middle_of_card :]

    for card_index in range(len(right_side)):
        final_shuffle.append(left_side[card_index])
        final_shuffle.append(right_side[card_index])

    faro_card = final_shuffle

print(final_shuffle)
