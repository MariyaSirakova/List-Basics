Write a program that receives a single string (integers separated by a comma and space ", "), finds all the zeros,
and moves them to the back without messing up the other elements. Print the resulting integer list.

string_line = list(map(int, input().split(', ')))

for _ in string_line:
    string_line.append(string_line.pop(string_line.index(0)))
print(string_line)
