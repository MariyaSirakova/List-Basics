You have initial energy 100 and initial coins 100. You will be given a string representing the working day events. Each 
event is separated with '|' (vertical bar, pipe)
Each event contains an event name or an ingredient and a number, separated by a dash (-).

• If the event is "rest":
 o You gain energy (the number in the second part). Note: your energy cannot exceed your initial energy 
(100). Print: "You gained {gained_energy} energy.". 
  o After that, print your current energy: "Current energy: {current_energy}."
  
• If the event is "order": 
  o You've earned some coins (the number in the second part). 
  o Each time you get an order, your energy decreases by 30 points.
▪ If you have the energy to complete the order, print: "You earned {earned} coins.".
▪ Otherwise, skip the order and gain 50 energy points. Print: "You had to rest!".

• In any other case, you have an ingredient you should buy. The second part of the event contains the coins
you should spend. 
o If you have enough money, you should buy the ingredient and print:
"You bought {ingredient}."
o Otherwise, print "Closed! Cannot afford {ingredient}." and your bakery rush is over. 

If you managed to handle all events throughout the day, print on the following 3 lines: 
"Day completed!"
"Coins: {coins}"
"Energy: {energy}"
