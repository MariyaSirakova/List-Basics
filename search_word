On the first line, you will receive a number n. On the second line, you will receive a word. On the following n lines,
you will be given some strings. You should add them to a list and print them. After that, you should filter out only
the strings that include the given word and print that list too.

number = int(input())
the_word = input()
strings = []

for _ in range(number):
    current_string = input()
    strings.append(current_string)

print(strings)

filtered_string = []

for i in strings:
    if the_word in i:
        filtered_string.append(i)

print(filtered_string)
