You will receive a sequence of numbers. Each number represents the time the car needs to pass through that step
(the index). There will be two cars. The first one starts from the left side, and the other one starts from the right
side. The middle index of the sequence is the finish line.
Calculate the total time each racer needs to reach the finish line and print the winner with his total time (the racer
with less time). If you have a zero in the list, you should reduce the racer's time that reached it by 20% (from his
current time).

number_line = input().split()
first_car = []
second_car = []
total_time_first_car = 0
total_time_second_car = 0
winner = ''
for num in number_line:
    finish_line = int(len(number_line)//2)

    first_car = number_line[: finish_line]
    second_car = number_line[finish_line +1 :]

for item in first_car:
    item = int(item)
    total_time_first_car += item
    if item == 0:
        total_time_first_car *= 0.80

for element in reversed(second_car):
    element = int(element)
    total_time_second_car += element
    if element == 0:
        total_time_second_car *= 0.80

if total_time_first_car < total_time_second_car:
    print(f"The winner is left with total time: {total_time_first_car:.1f}")

else:
    print(f"The winner is right with total time: {total_time_second_car:.1f}")
